# WeatherForecastDashboard
In this challenge we learned to use Server-Side APIs and how to link them into our Javascript, i also learned how to
properly use the "fetch" function to grab the URL and link it.

This challenge gave me trouble since i am still stuggling with javascript, especially with the API side of things,
I was motivated to continue on this project to better understand the code that i implemented by looking at my sources on
JQuery and MDN Web Docs
